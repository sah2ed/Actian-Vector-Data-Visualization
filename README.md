# Actian-Vector-Data-Visualization
Welcome to the Actian Vector Data Visualization tutorial!

All of the steps of the tutorial were conducted on a Linux virtual machine running Ubuntu Linux 16.04 so it is important to have a similar OS handy, before you begin.

The tutorial is organized progressively as fairly comprehensive chapters, so please complete it in the following order:
* [01_Actian-Vector](01_Actian-Vector.md)
* [02_Jupyter-Notebook](02_Jupyter-Notebook.md)
* [03_Actian-Vector-Data-Visualization](03_Actian-Vector-Data-Visualization.ipynb)
